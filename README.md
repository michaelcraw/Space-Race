SpaceRace1.java
two spaceships names USSEnterprise and Eagle5 race until the first one reaches quadrant 70. The spaceships will move based on a random number generator 1-10 output. The number that is produced will be between certain movements that are assigned by the spaceships. the while loop will continue the race until one reaches 70, produce a winner statement and end the program. If the ships land on the same quadrant, the program will say BUMP and the race will continue. If a ship goes left beyond the starting point, it will be placed back at the starting point.
